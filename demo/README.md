# GDNative demos

The top level folders split this repo into demos for different languages.
Each folder inside of those is a GDNative project. Once compiled, the
`project.godot` file can be opened with
[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org), the open source 2D and 3D game engine.

For non-GDNative demos (GDScript, VisualScript, and C#), please see the
[Godot demo projects](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/) repo.

## Godot versions

The [`master`](https://github.com/godotengine/gdnative-demos) branch
is compatible with the latest stable Godot version (currently 3.2).
Older Godot versions are not supported by this repo.
